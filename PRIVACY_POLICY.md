This Privacy Policy explains how the TypeChat AI Extension handles user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Data Collection
We want to be clear: **We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data**.

### What We Don't Collect

## How the Extension Works
The TypeChat AI Extension operates entirely locally within your browser. All functionality, including:
